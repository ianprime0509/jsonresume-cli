# JSON Resume CLI

This is a CLI tool for creating and formatting JSON Resumes. It is unrelated
to [the official JSON Resume CLI](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli),
but processes resumes in the same format (or, rather, a superset thereof).
Currently, integration with resume publishing platforms is not a goal of this
project.
